# SGDr (development version)

* The package has been totally re-constructed using OOP. 
Now we have 2 classes which are `Model` and `Parameters`, respectively. 
We have achieved same results and efficiency when applying these changes.
However the extensibility is much larger. 

* The `Model` class and `Parameters` class is still under development.
